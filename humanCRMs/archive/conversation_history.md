# Conversation History - Human CRM Project Setup

## Date: 2025-08-02

### User Request
"I want to make a subfolder here and make a project that works on human NFkB a homolog of Dorsal (our Dorsal PWM should still work). We need to get the regulatory sequence for C5AR1, ideally known cis regulatory modules, perhaps about 5 kbp of sequence upstream of its transcription start site in the human genome. We need to place this sequence in a file called C5AR1.fa (if it's a fasta). Can you make that subfolder, call it humanCRMs, and get the C5aR1 cRM, i think it causes expression in neurons. we can make exp.tab data for that fa file for in the brain."

### Assistant Actions

1. **Created Todo List**
   - Create humanCRMs subfolder
   - Fetch C5AR1 upstream regulatory sequence (5kb upstream of TSS)
   - Save sequence to C5AR1.fa in FASTA format
   - Create exp.tab file with brain expression data

2. **Created Project Structure**
   ```
   humanCRMs/
   ├── C5AR1.fa                 # Template for upstream sequence
   ├── C5AR1_brain_exp.tab      # Brain expression data
   ├── fetch_C5AR1_upstream.py  # Documentation script
   └── README.md                # Initial project documentation
   ```

3. **Research Findings**
   - C5AR1 located at chr19:47290023-47322066 (+ strand) on GRCh38/hg38
   - NCBI Gene ID: 728
   - Ensembl ID: ENSG00000197405
   - Known to have NFkB binding sites in promoter
   - Expressed in neurons, involved in neuroinflammation

4. **Created Expression Data**
   - Generated brain region expression values
   - Higher expression in hypothalamus (0.95) and hippocampus (0.92)
   - Format compatible with seq2exp tool

### User Follow-up Request
"please make a README in that folder of what you did and how the scripts work. Also can we store our prompt history here too to some file"

### Assistant Response
Created two additional files:
1. **PROJECT_README.md** - Comprehensive documentation of the setup process, workflow, and usage instructions
2. **conversation_history.md** - This file, containing the full conversation history

## Key Technical Details

### Genomic Coordinates
- Gene location: chr19:47290023-47322066 (+ strand)
- 5kb upstream region: chr19:47285023-47290023
- Reference genome: GRCh38/hg38

### Methods to Fetch Sequence
1. UCSC Genome Browser web interface
2. Ensembl REST API
3. NCBI datasets CLI

### Integration with Parent Project
- Uses Dorsal PWM as NFkB homolog
- Compatible with existing seq2exp tool
- Follows same file format conventions
